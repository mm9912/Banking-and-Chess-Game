# Banking-Information
2 straightforward Java programs.

Banking:
A Java program consisting of 2 Java files, named Banking and Customer. The Banking acts as the user interface of the program, where the user or multiple users are asked to input the banking information of customers. There are a total of 6 slots where banking information can be inputted. With the inputted balances of each customer, various calculations are done which involve searching for users who have an account balance of less than $150, the mean (average) calculated from all 6 user's bank balances, finding the highest and lowest balance out of the 6 customers, as well as displaying new bank balances after a 15% increase on all 6 users. The customer file acts as a subclass for the Banking file, as it handles all the calculations of the program and returns results to the Banking file when called upon. This project was done using Eclipse IDE, as it provided a suitable Java environment to create the program. 

How to run the program: Ensure that both the Java files of Banking and Customer are downloaded and in the same IDE. Open the Banking class and click Run to interact with the program.

Chess:
A Java program which allows the user to place the queen in any position on the chessboard up to a maximum of 10 times. An initial string is declared to set up the layout of the cheesboard, with each position being represented as *. The user is then asked to input the number of columns to insert a queen, meaning that in each row of 10 positions, from left to right, if the user inputs 2, the queen will be placed on spot 2 from left to right. The final chessboard is displayed showing where the queens are in each of the rows. The chessboard is a 2D array layout. The program was done using Eclipse IDE to provide a Java environment for the file to be created. 

How to run the program: Ensure that the Java file is downloaded and opened up in the IDE that the user is using. Click run to interact with the Java file, depending on which IDE is being used.
